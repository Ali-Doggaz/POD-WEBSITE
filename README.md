# Inspiration
We were inspired by our own goofiness and love of cartoons, as well as beginning our time together over the next twelve weeks.

# How I built it
We built it using HTML/CSS and JavaScript

# Challenges we ran into
We tried to use Gatsby, but many in our group were learning it for the first time, so ran into issues that come when you first use a development environment or learning a new laguage. But- we overcame!

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Working together as a group from so many time zones!

# What we learned
- Get organized on day one
- Use tools that multiple people in the group are already familar with so they can help teach others.

# What's next for Personal Portfolio
Adding more projects and creating a timeline

# Built With
HTML5
